# Mockup Sketch Design to Webpage 
This project is a mockup Sketch project turned into a webpage. The Mockup was created on Sketch by [sketchapptv](https://sketchapp.tv/). 

Tools used to aid the Front-end work were [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) and NPM and Gulp for compiling [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) and running a dev server and managing bower dependencies.
